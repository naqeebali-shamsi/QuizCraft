# Leaderboard App

This is a leaderboard application that allows users to view global and category-specific leaderboards for teams and individual players. Users can also filter leaderboards by time frame (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly, or all-time) and view detailed statistics for top-performing teams and players.

## Features

The leaderboard app offers the following features:

1. **Global and Category-Specific Leaderboards**: Users can view both global leaderboards that include all teams and players, as well as category-specific leaderboards that focus on specific criteria or categories.

2. **Filter by Time Frame**: Users can filter leaderboards based on different time frames such as daily, weekly, monthly, or all-time. This allows users to see how teams and players are performing within specific periods.

3. **Detailed Statistics**: The app provides detailed statistics for the top-performing teams and players. Users can gain insights into their performance, including metrics like win rate, average score, or any other relevant statistics.

```bash
serverless plugin install -n serverless-offline
```

It will add the `serverless-offline` plugin to `devDependencies` in `package.json` file as well as will add it to `plugins` in `serverless.yml`.

After installation, you can start local emulation with:

```
serverless offline
```

To learn more about the capabilities of `serverless-offline`, please refer to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline).
